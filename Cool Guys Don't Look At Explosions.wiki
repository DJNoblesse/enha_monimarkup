[[The Lonely Island]]의 2009년 [[MTV]] 어워드를 위해 [[J.J. 에이브람스]]와 함께 만든 ~~병맛~~노래이다. 한국어로 ~~굳이~~ 번역하자면 '''쿨가이는 폭발을 보지 않아'''. ~~이름부터 약이다~~

가사는 대략 이렇다.

>Seems like these days the whole world's on fire
>Things keep blowing the hell up
>And while all those rubber neckers and lucky louies stand and slackjaw's staring
>The real men have the nuts to walk away
>
>Yeah
>
>Cool guys don't look at explosions
>They blow things up and then walk away
>Who's got time to watch an explosion
>Cause cool guy's errand's that they have to walk too
>
>Keep walking, keep shining
>Don't look back, keep on walking
>Keep struttin', slow motion
>The more you ignore it, the cooler you look
>
>Ladies and gentlemen
>Please join me in welcoming, Mr. Neil Diamonds
>Ha ha ha, where are we
>
>Cool guys don't look at explosions
>They stride forward in their diamond covered boots
>They wear jumpsuits with glitter and rhinestones
>And walk away in slow motion..
>
>Keep walkin, you're cruisin..
>Cherry Cherry...Sweet Caroline..
>Denzel walks...
>Will Smith walks...
>Mark Wahlberg is wearin a hat!
>
>Keyboard solo, JJ Abrams!
>
>Yeah!
>
>Now you're talkin'
>
>Woohoo!
>
>Okay
>
>Because, Cool guys don't look at explosions
>The flames are hot but their heart is chilled
>Walk fast from the boring explosion
>And don't think about the people you've killed
>Two, three four!
>
>Aaaaaaaahh.....

~~[[무슨 마약하시길래 이런생각을 했어요|무슨 약하시길래 이런 뮤비를 만들었어요?]]?~~

보다시피 약의 완전체이다(...). ~~물론 [[The Lonely Island]]라는 그룹 자체도 약을 한트럭했지~~
그런데 그것이 최근에는 뭔가 [[폭발]]이 일어나는 상황에 대입하는 경우가 많다.
