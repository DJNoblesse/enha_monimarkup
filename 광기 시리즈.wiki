'The Insanity' 시리즈.

[[목차]]
== 개요 ==
[[더 하우스]]와 마찬가지로 플래시 [[호러 게임]] 중 하나.
단 더 하우스와 차이가 있다면, 더 하우스는 음성과 배경이 어두침침해서 불안감을 주지만, 이 게임은 [[고어]]도가 높다. 
출처는 인새니티 위키아.
참고로 제작자 Evilkris씨는 [리빌드]2(를 기반으로 한 리빌드 모바일도)의 일러스트를 담당했다.

== 시리즈 ==
 * [[광기 1]]

 * 광기 2
 [[http://www.gameshed.com/Scary-Games/The-Insanity-2/play.html 게임을 플레이 할 수 있는 링크.]] 극도로 고어하므로 사진은 첨부할 수 없다.
 3부작 중 2편. 1편의 내용에서 이어지는 것이 아니라, 그 이전에 있었던 사건들을 다루는 [[프리퀄]]격 작품이다. 어떻게 비버섹트들이 생겨나고, 어떤 배경이 있었는지 알 수 있는 작품. 액션성보다는 퍼즐성이 강조되었고, 컨트롤을 요구하므로 난이도가 높아졌다면 높아졌다고 할 수 있다.
 [[에드가 프렌들리]]의 쌩얼을 볼 수 있는 작품. 이 편은 에드가의 시점이 아닌, [[피터 랭던]]의 시점에서 플레이 한다.

 * 광기 3
 개발중이며, 네이산 랭던이 주인공으로 내정되어 있다.

== 등장 인물 ==
[[주인공(광기1)]]

[[피터 랭던]]

[[에드가 프렌들리]]

[[프로젝트 K]]

[[트레이시 타카키]]

[[네이산 랭던]] : 광기 3의 주인공이자 피터 랭던의 동생. 경찰관. 공개된 프롤로그에선 졸음운전을 하다가 사건에 휘말리는 듯.

[[알렉산더]][* 단 알렉산더의 경우 광기 1에서는 비버섹트로 등장한다.]

[[레스터 래퍼티]] : 광기 2에 나오는 비버섹트 중 하나다. 인간성을 잃지 않은 상태로 등장하며 코드네임은 크툴루.--뭐?--

[[존]], [[라스]] --알렉산더슨-- : 피터 랭던의 동료다. 하지만...

== 비버섹트 ==

Vivisects are the poor souls that were kidnapped by Edgar Friendly and his assistants in the search of the perfect God-made creature. Edgar turned them into monsters by replacing their body parts with that of animals' and erased their humanity with drugs that destroyed their memories. Most of them don't last that long after the surgeries are complete. Friendly has a habit of making videos of his experiments and placing them on the Internet. These videos were taken down due to them being too graphic, but they survived when they were placed on shock video web sites, where their popularity grew and grew.
덤으로, 이 비버섹트 중 일부는 예전 EvilKris씨가 만들었던 'The Damned'란 플래시의 괴물을 차용한것이다.
혹자의 개인 로컬라이징도 첨부되어있으며 원래 이름을 같이 올리니 참고하시길.

=== 광기 1 등장 개체 ===

수감자(The Prisoner)

17번째 비버섹트이다. 오체불만족 상태로 주인공을 맞이하며 결과는...

조각상(The Statue)

This beast is disguised as a statue of Constantine. He looks freakishly disgusting. Also, an altered victim like the prisoner you encountered about 15 seconds ago. (make that 20.) It was the 9th Vivisect to be created. 

치유사(The Clinician)

Probably one of Edgar's colleagues. He used to be a reknown scientist, but now,all day he does is construct and supply the neurological inhibitor compounds. In plain English, memory erasers.He is barely human, but his face is as if from a monkey came. Which it is. He is one of the few vivisects that have enough intelligence to actually speak clearly. He was the 3rd vivisect to created by Friendly. 



지하도귀(The Tunnel Monster)

닥터의 또 다른 창조물. 그는 외과적으로 변형된 희생자인데, 반은 숫염소, 반은 침팬지의 모습을 하고 있다. 그는 프렌들리가 만든 4번째 비비섹트이다.


피조물(The Creature)

페이크 최종보스이다. 처음 '수감자'를 죽이는게 이 녀석. 처음 주인공은 이 녀석을 '의사'로 알고 있었지만 사실은..

알렉산더

알렉산더(또는 랫페이스)는 외과적으로 변형된 희생자이다. 그는 광기2에서도 인간으로 출연한다. 그는 정비공이었는데, 침입자들을 위한 트랩을 만들 것을 강요받았다. 또한 그는 연주를 잘하는 피아니스트이기도 하다. 그는 프로젝트 K에게 베인 이후 죽는다. 그는 15번째로 만들어진 비비섹트이다.

욕실에 있던 그의 찢어진 살거죽을 가진 희생자는 프렌들리에 의해 만들어진 14번째 희생자이다.



=== 광기 2 등장 개체 ===


키마이라

프로젝트 k 대신 등장한 최종보스.
Diversified caniform subjects were combined on this subject top observe homo sapien/carnivora tissue unification. Pronounced snout gives wolf-like appearance. Dental code molar 2/1, C 0/0, P 3/2, M 3/3. Mouth contains aradicular hypsodont open-rooted teeth that have continuous growth. (All teeth incisive - molars remain for chewing). Titanium plating reinforced alloys fused to bones herald bulletproof-like resistence to impact. Social and loyal under mild sedative influence. He is the original "Lucifer" from the game "The Damned" It was the 5th vivisect to be created. 



프로젝트 K

Edgar often talked of his profound sadness at the death of his twin brother he lost in their car crash 5 years ago. Upon his revelation that we know had discovered the capability to instigate reanimation of dead matter, he capriciously and -against my wishes- had his sibling's body exhumed. We neglected to give him a proper name, he is simply known as "K". All projects name alphabetically but K was the first one not to die after advanced surgical modifications. His size (6.8ft) inspired us to use him as a makeshift personal bodyguard. His body is tailored for collosal endurance and power. Stimulated calcium reinforced bones.Economy of osteodermic ridging along the limbs. Intense training and stereoid orthopedic protein synthesis and strict training regime results in lost agility, but made up for in raw power. There's no human with his strength. To our disappointment the brain deterioration was far gone, he is severly mentally retarded, and a mishap in surgery resulted in his much losing of his vocal facilities. Periodically needs to remaintain muscular stability therefore is in stasis recovery chamber at the time of this log. 

Also appeared in The Insanity, and he is the original "Evil K." from the game "The Damned" Project K was the 1st Vivisect to be created by Friendly. He was hard to be killed by everyone. 



유령(Specter)

Facultive mutualistic bioluminescent bactocyclophia implanted within skin cells. Has an appearance not unlike that of certain translucent marine invertebrates. Visually supernatural in appearance,admirable to the eye and 
personally one of our favorites. Due to the breakdown of skin cell tissue body is relatively weak and fragile. Organs have been supersized to capacitate stimulated energy via muscle mitochondria genetic therapy.Metabolism is rapid and as a result can move at high speeds cardiac arrest.Seems almost invisible when in full mobilisation. He is conventionally nomadic and childlike -as are most of the vivisects- unsure about his new form. Prefers to be solitary. Zootoxin glands we have implanted create venomous bite to compensate for his lack of physical hunting ability. He is the 6th vivisect to be created. 



사르코서스

Cold-blooded reptilian implants are abount in this subject. One of our first experiments and for the most part a failure. Pituitary protein based poly-peptides resulted in giantism. Creature is almost 2.5 meters tall several sizes larger than standard deviations.energy-dense high fat diet. Multicolored oil droplets in the photoreceptors, opsin proteins in the cones detect wavelengths in the uv range Gavital scutum vascular layers around the post-op human tissue make for cumbersome lurking movement. It is a miracle the creature didn't die via displaced organ rejection. Expected life-span is less than 3 weeks. Non-complaint with sedative coersive persuation therefore extremely dangerous to anyone in proximity barricaded within the lower levels and acts as added protection for inner accomodations. It has the 8th vivisect to be created by Friendly. 



섬광귀(Shimmer)

Edgar wanted to at this time to research scenesence - the base subject was aged into his 80's at the time of his acquisition. Dysregulated waste cell breakdown has been altered. Normal cell division has been reverted, modified and epithelial tissue now highly regenerative- condusive to rapid healing and youthful appearance. One unfortunate side-effect of the treatment he received is damage to the intergumentary system resulting in extreme xenoderma pigmentosis(dry skin). Eye sensitivity is high, stimulated sebaceous glands are as yet non-productive, therefore we have housed him temporarily in the basement area. Humified moisture and mineral oils have been applied to the floors and walls as must be kept lubricated at all times. Minimal mobile activity. All house inhabitants have been warned not to go within near proximity and incineragens have been strictly forbidden. Mental acuity is more stable in this subject leading us to conclude it may be the time for us begin working on a "smart" vivisect range. He was the 10th vivisect to be created by Friendly. 



크툴루

Nothing to say about him. On the computer it simply says "Destroy on sight!" He was the 11th vivisect to be created. His real name is Lester Rafferty, a family man who was taken away from his wife and daughter and after the experiments, was given the appearence of an octopus-like vivisect and was named after the monster from H. P. Lovecraft's books. He had enough humanity to verbally aid Peter Langdon in escaping. Lester escaped after he heard something coming after him. Lester's fate is unknown.
