제목은 [[스콧 피츠제럴드]]의 연인~~이자 썅년으로 잘 알려진~~ 젤다 피츠제럴드의 말에서 따왔다고 한다. 그녀는 따분함을 느끼기를 주로 거부했는데, 왜냐면 그녀가 따분한 인간이 아니었기 때문이다.(She refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn't boring.)

싱글 발매 당시에는 UK싱글 차트에서 최고 순위 20위에 그쳤으나 이후 펫 샵 보이즈의 명곡을 꼽을 때 반드시 거론되는 곡 중 하나가 되었다. 닐 테넌트는 1993년 인터뷰에서 자신들이 썼던 최고의 곡들 중 하나로 이 곡을 거론했으며, 이 곡만을 위한 팬사이트 [http://www.10yearsofbeingboring.com/ 10 Years of Being Boring]도 있다.

== 가사 ==
||I came across a cache of old photos
And invitations to teenage parties
"Dress in white" one said, with quotations
From someone's wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you're young you find inspiration
In anyone who's ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: "We were never feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end"

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: "If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies"
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

And we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"
And we were never being boring
We were never being bored
'Cause we were never being boring
We were never being bored||
