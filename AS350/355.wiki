AS350 Ecureuil/AS355 Ecureuil II

[[목차]]
= 개요 =
[[프랑스]]의 아에로스퍄살사에서 개발되고, 제작사가 [유로콥터]에 합병된 뒤 쭉 유로콥터에서 제작되는 경[헬리콥터]. 대략적으로 설명하면 유럽의 [[Bell 206]]이라고 할 수 있다. Bell 206과 장단점이 있으나, 대체로 비행성능과 진동등의 면에서 206보다 낫다는 평가를 받는다. 구매 및 유지비가 저렴하고 운영이 편하다는 것이 특징. 350와 355 두 기종의 차이점은 엔진수로 AS355는 안정성을 위해 엔진을 2개로 하여 배기구가 2개인 것으로 구분이 가능하다. 물론 엔진이 2개인지라 가격이 그만큼 상승하여 AS350보다 판매량은 적다. 그래도 두 기종 모두 [베스트셀러]로서, 두 기종의 군용 버전인 [AS550/555] Fennec도 존재한다. 한편 AS350은 이후의 파생형인 [EC-130]의 기초도 되었다.
