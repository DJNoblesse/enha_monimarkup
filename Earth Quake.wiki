노트 수가 무려 2821개로 국내 오투잼에서 가장 많은 곡이었다. [[End Of Fight]] 등장 전까지 한동안 오투잼 [[최종보스|최고 난이도]] 곡이었다. [[채보]]는 욕 안 먹으면서 정정당당(?)하게 어렵고 노래도 좋다는 평을 듣는다.

||Here we go

Bring that beat back

Microphone set yo microphone rec
Code Red war like “AWACS” on the “revved up” cassette
Cause I’m a soldier giving me the nerves like boulder
Making a vocal call putting the lights out the storm
Airwaves uproar like a cellular phone
I hate snakes like Indiana Jones
while “harakatan” did the tracks like storm
mixing tracks like “tapper” rhymes busted thorugh your bones
I get your Heart and I'd never wanna
Feel you like “drama” or
Gee cause my rhyme is the key
Open up your mind and pass in the energy
To me it is as easy as 1, 2, 3
I make DO with the RE and MI
Shine, on your mind, get busy one time
Let the girls know that you're good to go
I'll rock the show like I'll rock you whole

Just this alley straight off the main “tow”
because I “ricochet” it just get better
and then i come out of the light because you know i'm legit
i'm just in Hollywood let you know that'd be good
just got the style let soak for some time
and then i rock your microphone and make a “yaboodoowah”
because i'm just rashee* i give you what you need
wipping niggas up at the break next week
I get your Heart and I'd never wanna
Feel you like “drama” or
Gee cause my rhyme is the key
Open up your mind and pass in the energy
To me it is as easy as 1, 2, 3
I make DO with the RE and MI
Shine, on your mind, get busy one time
Let the girls know that you're good to go
I'll rock the show like I'll rock you whole||
