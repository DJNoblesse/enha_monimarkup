대표적인 러브크래프티안 작가들중 한분으로, 대표적인 작품으로는 그 유명한 [[틴달로스의 사냥개]]와 우주를 먹는자(the space eater)로, 작품자체로 볼때는 틴달로스의 사냥개는 오히려 미숙하고 우주를 먹는자가 더 뛰어나지만, 어쩐지 아는사람이 거의 없다(...)

[[러브크래프트]]와 특별한 우정을 가지기도 했는데, 러브크래프트는 프랭크를 친구이자 멘토로 삼았다고한다.

=== 시 ===

 The Goblin Tower (Cassia FL: Dragon-Fly Press, 1935; New Collectors Group, 1945. Note: Due to the somewhat misleading publisher's introduction to the 1945 edition, it is often mis-catalogued as a reprint of the 1935 Dragon-Fly Press edition. In fact, the selection of poems differs; the New Collectors Group edition drops four, "When Chaugner Wakes," "Exotic Quest," "West Indies" and "Martial: The Vacationist" and adds three, "The Prophet," "Prediction" and "Walt Whitman."
