[소닉 더 헤지혹(2006)]의 테마곡으로 작곡은 세가 소속의 작곡가이자 본작의 사운드 디렉터 [오오타니 토모야]가 작곡하고 외국 펑크록 그룹인 Zebrahead의 멤버 알리 타바타베(Ali Tabatabaee)와 매티 루이스(Matty Lewis)가 보컬을 담당한 곡.[* [소닉 더 헤지혹 시리즈]는 어드벤처 때부터 [[Crush40]] 이 테마곡을 도맡아왔으나 이번에는 이 그룹이 맡았다. [[소닉 월드 어드벤처]]도 crush40이 아닌 재럿 레딕(Jaret Reddick)이 테마곡을 맡았다.] 다만 본작이 하필 태어나선 안 될 흑역사이라서 붙은 별명이 '''저주받은 명곡'''.

작품은 까고 또 까이고 가루가 되도록 까였지만 이 음악만큼은 ''''이 게임에서 유일하게 깔 수 없다'''',  ''''[[wiki:"OST는 좋았다" 이 따위 게임에 쓰기엔 아깝다]]''''는 평이 많다.

== 가사 ==
{{|C'mon and light the fuse, he's a rocket and he's ready to go,

'Cause now the countdown has started and he's ready to blow.

He's got the dope sounds pumpin' in his stereo. (-eo!)

Kickin' ass fast, puttin on a show.

Go on and get yourself together, there's no time to rest.

And if you put the time in, he'll put you to the test.

He's like a running man, in his world more is less,

And if you wanna test him best, bring your best.

Don't make me spell it out, bring your best!


In this world... (His world!)

Where life is strong.

In this world... (His world!)

Life's an open book.

In this world... (His world!)

Where compromise does not exist.

In his world of worlds, every step meets the rest!


In this world... (His world!)

Where one is all.

In this world... (His world!)

Never fear the fall.

In this world... (His world!)

Where compromise does not exist.

In his world of worlds, every step meets the rest!


Runnin' it back again, well what'dja expect?

Comin' at ya with ten outta ten, got a real rough neck!

Spikes up his liberty, straps on his shoes.

'Cause he's the best there ever was, haven't ya heard the news?

Intergalactic, continental champ runnin' things,

Hyperactive, instrumental, and pulling strings.

He's the one who understands when the tides will swing,

So he's breakin' down doors, never following.

C'mon and psyche yourself up, 'cause its time to play.

Bounce to the beats and the rhymes, 'cause they're here to stay.

The one and only marathon man, livin' the day.

Movin' up, comin' fast and he'll blow you away!

Because the pressures of this world, they can take their toll.

And it's tough to get away when they take their hold.

The only way to break free is to break the mold.

You can't stop now, lock and load.

Don't stop now, c'mon, rock n' roll!


In this world... (His world!) (Gotta make your own way!)

Where life is strong.

In this world... (His world!) (Life is just a game you play!)

Life's an open book.

In this world... (His world!) (Nothing's forever here to stay!)

Where compromise does not exist.

In his world of worlds, every step meets the rest!


In this world... (His world!) (Gotta make your own way!)

Where one is all.

In this world... (His world!) (Life is just a game you play!)

Never fear the fall.

In this world... (His world!) (Nothing's forever here to stay!)

Where compromise does not exist.

In his world of worlds, every step meets the rest!


Light the fuse on his rocket and he's ready to go,

'Cause now the countdown has started and he's ready to blow!

(In his world....!)

(Where one is all!)

Intergalactic, continental champ runnin' things,

Hyperactive, instrumental and pulling strings!

(In his world....!)

(Never fear the fall!)


(In his world....!) The only way to break free is to break the mold!

You can't stop now, lock and load!

(His world!) I said you can't stop now, lock and load!

(His world!) Don't stop now, c'mon and rock & roll!|}}

== 다른 버전들 ==
오리지날 버전 외에 Zebrahead에서 자체적으로 편곡한 버전[* 현악기 연주 파트가 사라졌고 속도가 상당히 빨라졌으며 후렴구를 약간 바꾸었다]과 [Crush40]이 편곡한 버전 등이 있고, 최종보스전에서는 오케스트라 버전을 들을 수 있다. 마지막으로 게임에 쓰이지 않은 Blue World Prelude 버전이 있다.

[[메탈아머]]가 괴상한 버전으로 부르기도 하였다[[http://mabinogi.nexon.com/C3/Community/Comic.asp?mode=view&corner=87&page=2&ReadSn=95111 소음+욕설 주의]].
