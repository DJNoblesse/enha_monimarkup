==== Incarcerus Notes 1 ~ 11 ====

 *Incarcerus Notes 1 

>Day One. The inmates are doing well. There had been some in-fighting, but this was quickly tempered with some short blasts of cold water. Observing the chatter, it is surprisingly how quickly the Miniknog soldiers are adapting to life behind bars. 


>The Apex citizens are not adopting their guard roles quite so easily. They are hesitant, unsure of themselves, and unwilling to assert their authority over the prisoners. This is interesting, as my original hypothesis predicted that the citizens would quickly turn on the Miniknog. 


>Perhaps current Miniknog methods are fully effective in conditioning the citizens to obey. Perhaps Big Ape is wrong to be concerned. But still, this is only day one of the experiment, and a lot could change. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 2 

>The Miniknog are beginning to gain control of the experiment. Despite having taken on the role of prisoners, the dynamic is very clear. They do what they want, and in some cases even tell the citizens - the guards - what to do. It is very interesting to observe. 


>Earlier, I visited the common room to find the Miniknog playing ball games, and the citizens locked in the cells. The self-styled leader of the Miniknog prisoners, Hairbiter McVey, informed me that they'd requested some 'chill-out time'. 


>I will have to talk to the citizens, explain to them that to become prison guards, they must be more assertive. Years of Miniknog oppression has left them timid shells. While this was good for our original purposes, it now leaves us with an army of Apex who are incapable of serving us. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 3 

>The citizens are beginning to assert themselves. The Miniknog prisoners had overturned a vending machine and were stripping it of bananas and the like. The citizens approached and very politely asked them to stop. 

>The Miniknog ignored them, and the citizens sheepishly left, but still, it's progress. I suggested to them that perhaps grovelling and begging is not the best way to show authority, but they just looked confused. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 4 

>It has become clear to me that Big Ape has created an army of useless Apex. Our Glorious Leader may be the most powerful being in the universe, but here he has been somewhat short-sighted. Thankfully I am the one tasked with fixing this. 


>My first step must be to come up with a method of making the citizens more proactive, while still remaining in the thrall of the Miniknog. As such, I have scrapped the current experiment and converted the prison into a gladiatorial arena. Perhaps this shall yield better results. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 5 

>The first fights went down today. The Apex citizens versus a bunch of monsters we captured. This went pretty well. Only one casualty, and the Apex were perfectly capable of fending for themselves. The Miniknog helped by cheering them on and commanding them to fight. 

>Turns out the Apex citizens are still formidable fighters when it comes down to it. Monster parts everywhere. Even the Miniknog seemed impressed. Big Ape watched via video link, of course, and expressed his concerns about the Apex being too competent, but he hasn't seen the thrall in which the Miniknog still hold them. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 6 

>Recently, I contacted my old friend Greenfinger. As usual, he came through for me, and provided me with what I asked for. Ten angry, rabid Florans, out for a fight. I questioned him as to whether they were prisoners, and he said no, they were just bored. 


>I attempted to brief the Florans on how the battle should go down, but I don't think I got through to them. In fact, I narrowly avoided being impaled by a rogue Floran spear. Greenfinger did warn me, I suppose. Tomorrow, they shall fight my Apex.

 *Incarcerus Notes 7 

>Well that's that experiment over for now. Nine Florans remain, and no Apex. And I don't just mean the citizens either, the Miniknog guards fell afoul of the Floran menace too. I tried to stop them, but Big Ape commanded me to let it play out. 


>I admit, it was interesting to watch. The Apex may possess great physical strength, but the Floran outmatch them in all areas. Big Ape is plotting something. He told me to wait before restarting the experiment. I, in the meantime, have to herd nine angry Florans back into their quarters. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 8 

>Big Ape has tasked me with finding a way to ensure our Apex soldiers are capable of taking down a Floran with ease. I thought about the long, hard, gruelling training regimen this would involve. Even if we just focused on the Miniknog soldiers, it would take forever. 


>No, something better is required. We need a breed of Apex who is stronger, better, faster than the rest. Front-line soldiers who are capable of leading the charge, and dealing the brunt of the damage. 


>I've put in another call to Greenfinger. I know that Floran DNA is very malleable, and can be spliced rather easily. I need his permission to experiment on the Florans he sent, and knowing Greenfinger, he'll happily grant it. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 9 

>Unusually, Greenfinger had stipulations in regards to my experiments. I could do what I wished, as long as he was in attendance. He arrived at my lab moments after receiving my agreement, almost as if he'd been here the whole time. 


>Being in the presence of Greenfinger is, as usual, disconcerting. Every time I turn around and see him, I am forced to ensure I don't recoil in alarm. Not that Greenfinger is the sensitive sort. 


>He is a brilliant, brilliant scientist however. I feel like a child fumbling in the dark in comparison. Within half a day, he had perfected a theoretical gene-splice between the Florans and the Apex, and constructed a plan for slow-burning experimentation. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 10 

>Greenfinger entered the lab early this morning to find me working away diligently. I was attempting to deconstruct the Floran DNA strands in the hope I could find an even quicker solution to the DNA merge. Greenfinger lost his temper. 


>I have never seen my friend behave this way. At one stage, I almost feared for my life. He smashed equipment, shouted and screamed. I began to suspect he was scared. This, in turn, scared me. 


>Finally I calmed my friend down. He apologised, and I asked him to explain. And explain he did. His explanation shocked me to the very core. The secret he has been hiding for all these years... it could change everything. 

 *Incarcerus Notes 11 

>Greenfinger finally left, today. The experiment - following his plan, of course - is set to go ahead. I think he was hesitant to make an exit, after imparting certain knowledge upon me. 


>He swore me to secrecy, of course. I am a respected scientist, and he knows that I value my oaths above all else. And yet... this information I have come to possess, the value it holds, is astronomical. 


>I will keep quiet for Greenfinger, though. I shall say nothing. And he will never know what it means to me to have been brought into his trust, to share the burden of his secret, a burden he has carried alone for centuries. We will get through this, old friend.

==== Blog of a Lab Assistant 1 ~ 10 ====

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 1 

>Yesterday I was prodding and poking at tiny monster corpses, working out how they tick. Today, I'm assistant to the most brilliant Apex mind in history (aside from Big Ape, of course), working on a top secret, important project. 

>It's funny how your life can change! I never thought my talent would be noticed, and yet here I am. Doctor Lax is a stern, serious woman. She's very focused on work. This suits me fine. Already, the lab workers who slack off have been let go. 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 2 

>The experiments we are doing make me somewhat uncomfortable. Remember Randy, the guy I often complained about who never took the work seriously? Well, apparently he 'volunteered' as a test subject today. 

>I've never seen a volunteer seem so resistant. We strapped him down, and began pumping him full of some kind of chemical or other. Thankfully, whatever it was seemed to have no effect on him, as he was back in the mess hall joking around that night. 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 3 

>Last night, a calamity occurred. An intruder broke into our lab and trashed the place. Doctor Lax was incredibly edgy about it all. She spent hours looking to see if anything had been taken. It did not seem to have been. 

>Randy was missing, though. Didn't show up for the second phase of his trials, not that they could go ahead. Doctor Lax put in a number of calls, and soon we were being transported off-world, to a secret location. It all happened so fast. 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 4 

>Turns out, the plan is to keep our lab mobile, never staying in one place for too long. I asked Doctor Lax how this benefits the experiment, but she screamed angrily at me and told me to mind my own business. 

>I am beginning to suspect that this change has nothing to do with our experiment, and everything to do with Doctor Lax. Just what is it she's running from? Am I in danger myself? Find out in the next exciting instalment of my blog! 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 5 

>Test subjects are coming in thick and fast now. They're divided into three groups, and then their treatment begins. There's the control group, obviously, then a group who are treated with Formula H and Formula F. I'm working on the Formula F test group. 

>I'd love to share details on the experiment here, but even I can't risk that. It's very exciting though. However, it makes me uncomfortable realising that our test subjects aren't volunteers. Some are impoverished Apex citizens, but some are Resistance soldiers, captured. Of course, I should have no sympathy for them, but... 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 6 

>We came into the lab today to find all of the Formula H test subjects dead. Their bodies had just shut down. Doctor Lax treated it as if it was expected. Maybe it was. She's acting strange lately. I don't like it. 

>Lax has her own experimental chamber, and there's definitely something in there. I hear noises. I'm often the last one in the lab, and I won't lie, it creeps me out. I hear growling, and banging on the doors, and sometimes even low sobbing. 

>One day, I'm going to be brave enough to take a look. Just a quick peek. I've seen the access code Lax enters. I could get in. I just... I'm nervous. The test chamber is marked with so many 'danger' signs that I feel hesitant. 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 7 

>We are to be visited by Big Ape himself. This is unprecedented. The atmosphere in the lab is one of excitement and terror. None of us have ever seen Big Ape in the flesh before! I have to admit, I get a fanboy shiver every time I think about it. 

>In other news, Doctor Lax has become more withdrawn, working away in her experiment chamber at all hours of the day and night. I've had no opportunity to take a look. I'm almost relieved. 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 8 

>The Formula F test subjects are producing great results. At least, that's what I'm told. I like to think I have a great understanding of my work, but even then, I can't fathom exactly what's going on here. It doesn't help that half the results are redacted. 

>I feel like my role here is to press buttons and flip switches, and nothing more. Doctor Lax, when she bothers to emerge from her test chamber at all, simply snatches the results from my hand and stalks off. It's all very disconcerting. 

>Lax has been especially jumpy lately, too. She's surrounding herself with Miniknog guards, even having them search us each day as we enter the lab. It's no longer an enjoyable working environment. Still, at least we have Big Ape's visit to look forward to.

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 9 

>I'm writing this from beneath a desk. I'm hiding. If I don't make it out of here, spread my story. Make sure the universe knows what happened. I can hear gunfire, and screams, and a terrible, pained roaring sound. 

>Big Ape arrived. Just knocked on the door and announced he was here. Of course, I threw it open excitedly. Doctor Lax, stepping out of her chamber, screamed for me to stop, but it was too late. A figure stood there, wearing an ill-fitting ape costume. 

>Tearing off the costume, the creature tossed me aside. I've never seen a beast like it. It was sentient; it spoke to Doctor Lax, told her that her time was up, that the Ring of Thorns had found her. It began to chase her through the compound, as I cowered beneath my desk. 

 *Blog of a Lab Assistant 10 

>The sounds of fighting had died down. I saw the creature, the assassin, stalking out of the building, seemingly content with its work. I waited, then cautiously made my way out, towards the test chamber, the door ajar. 

>I peered inside, unsure of what I'd find. There, Doctor Lax lay slumped inside a large capsule, a syringe stuck in her neck, pumping what appeared to be a combination of Formula F and H into her veins. She was dead, of course. 

>Whatever had been inside the test chamber originally was long gone. But Doctor Lax's notes remained. This... this changes everything. What we've been doing, what we've been working towards, it's an abomination. How could Big Ape condone this? 

>My next blog post will blow this whole thing wide open. I'm going into hiding. I need to make sure I'm safe, and then I'm blowing the whistle on all of this. The Miniknog - Big Ape himself - must be stopped. 

==== A Ludicrous Annoyance ====

>How am I meant to further the Apex species when our labs get attacked? And by a member of the Ring of Thorns, no less. That Thornwing will get an earful next time we have cocktails. 

>I sent my elite Miniknog guards to clean up the mess. Doctor Lax's body was gone. What kind of lunatic kidnaps a body! Oh well. Probably eaten by Florans. Managed to recover some of the notes and that, so I've hired another doctor to carry on with the research. 

>On the plus side, my Miniknog spies were able to track down that annoying blogger who kept posting NDA-protected information. He's hiding out in a human prison, of all places. Might place a call to Thornwing to deal with him, I guess. 

==== A Scribbled Note ====

>Memories black. Feel... pain. Changes. I was... I was... I feel the formulas. Remember who did this.

 아무것도 기억나지않아. 고통...스러워... 변했어. 내가... 내가... 약기운이 느껴져... 기억해내야돼... 누가 나에게 이런짓을 했는지...

>Remember. Florans. Thorns. Big Ape. All crush. All crush. 

 기억났다.. 플로란, Thornswing, 빅 에이프. 부숴버릴거야.. 모두 부숴버릴거야...
==== Greenfinger's Notes: Loose Ends ====

>Unhappy to have left the Apex compound. Sharing our species' secret is not something I take lightly. My acquaintance, the Apex scientist Doctor Lax, can be trusted. I have utter faith in her. 

>And yet, this is not something I can leave up to faith. I was barely off-planet before putting the call in to Thornwing. The Ring of Thorns have been dispatched. No loose ends. It is how we've survived thus far, and how we will continue to survive. 

>I am sorry, Doctor.

==== Big Ape ====

>by Greenfinger of the Floran 
>I will admit, the ape is not to my tastes. He is brash, boorish and a poor tactician. His insistence in appearing behind a video screen is tiresome - he forgets I know all his little secrets. 

 인정하지. 난 그녀석[* Big Ape] 이 별로야. 그는 성급하고, 버릇없으며 비열한 전략가야. 그가 화면 뒤에서 복종을 강요하는것은 정말이지 짜증이나. 내가 그의 작은 비밀들까지 다 알고있는걸 잊었나봐?

>And yet, he's an invaluable ally. I may not agree with his methods, but his goals are sound. And he has the ear of the self-styled lord, Thornwing. Strange times make for strange bedfellows. It's not like anything is conventional these days.

 그럼에도, 그는 또한 중요한 동맹자이기도 해. 그의 통치방식은 마음에 안 들지만, 그가 이루어낸 업적이 많은건 확실하거든. 자칭 군주 Thornwing도 그의 편이야. 시대가 바뀌었어. 모든것이 관습적인 것만은 아니야.
==== The Steel Casebook: Apex ====

>by Hewlett Deckard, Glitch bounty hunter 
>Arriving at an Apex settlement always fills me with sadness. The Apex plight is not unlike the Glitch's, but a thousand times worse. Here, Big Ape and his awful Miniknog have broken the population, reducing them to mindless slaves. 

 글리치 현상금사냥꾼,Hewlett Deckard 씀
 에이펙스의 거류지에 올때마다 안타깝다는 생각이 들어. 에이펙스의 처지는 글리치만큼, 아니, 글리치보다 천배는 더 나쁠거야. Big Ape와 끔직한 미니크녹 군사들이 인구수를 줄이고 에이펙스들을 생각하지못하는 노예로 만들어버렸어. 

>Put a foot wrong, and the Miniknog are on you. Do nothing wrong, and chances are they will be anyway. I hear talk of mysterious labs on remote planets, of horrific experiments and terrifying beasts. 

 말 한번 잘못하면 미니크녹 병사가 어김없이 널 찾아가지. 잘못한게 없어도, 언제든지 병사들이 널 찾아올 여지가 있어. 난 어느 외진 행성의 비밀연구소에 대한, 소름끼치는 연구와 무시무시한 괴물들에 대한 이야기를 들어 본적도 있어.
==== A Folk Tale ====

>When Big Ape was just a little ape, his home village was attacked by creeping horrors from beyond the stars. These vile penguins set everything to the torch, and Big Ape was forced to watch as his village burned. 

 Big Ape가 어렸을 때, 그의 고향은 습격을 받았다. 사악한 팽귄무리가 사방에 불을 질렀고, Big Ape는 그의 고향이 불타는걸 지켜보고 있을 수 밖에 없었다. 

>Big Ape swore revenge, and revenge he got. As the penguins were leaving in their space pirate ship, he fired a grappling hook at them and pulled the ship down to earth, using nothing but his strength. After that, penguins never burned his village down again.

 그는 복수를 맹세했다. 그리고 그는 복수하는데 성공했다. 팽귄무리가 우주해적선을 떠날 때를 노려, 그는 갈고랑쇠를 쏘아 오직 그의 힘만으로 배를 당겨 땅으로 떨어뜨렸다. 그후 팽귄무리는 다시는 그의 마을을 불태울 수 없었다.
==== Friends to the End ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer 
>So I hit upon a genius idea! If the Resistance and the Miniknog could just talk it out, then maybe things could get smoothed over. I'm sure Big Ape is not the villain they think, if only they'd get to know him. So I tunnelled out of my room and found the nearest Miniknog platoon. 

 하이로틀 모험가,Hiraki Corale 씀
 그래서 나는 기막힌 생각 하나를 떠올렸지. 만약 저항군과 미니크녹 군사들이 대화를 할 수 있다면 둘의 관계가 나아질 것 같았어. Big Ape는 그들이 생각하는 것처럼 나쁘지 않다고 난 확신할 수 있었어. 저항군이 Big Ape와 만날수 있다면 좋을텐대. 그래서 나는 방에서 나와 근처의 미니크녹 소대를 찾아갔지.

>Filled with positivity, I led them to the Resistance hideout and told them that if they didn't sort out their differences, I'd knock their heads together. So smart! Well, I think it went okay! I didn't stick around to find out for sure, of course, I had to meet back up with Greenfinger, but I saw them all marching together through the town square as we left. 

 기쁜 마음으로, 난 병사들을 저항군의 아지트로 대려가서 만약 그들이 둘 사이의 불화를 해결하지 못한다면 혼쭐을 내주겠다했어. 똑똑하지! 음, 난 분명히 잘 해결될거라 생각했어. 물론 난 거기 계속 있지는 않았지. Greenfinger를 다시 만나야 했거든. 근대 나랑 Greenfinger가 떠날 때, 저항군들이 마을 광장으로 행진 하는걸 봤거든. 뭘까?

==== A Pleasant Town ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer 
>I find myself in a Miniknog-controlled Apex town. But oh, control is such an ugly word, isn't it? The Apex here are all so polite, and friendly. They bow and grovel as I pass, my Miniknog entourage only occasionally having to knock them back! 


>It's all very exciting. An audience with Big Ape! Greenfinger told me he's heard about my exploits, and would like to pick my brain. I mean gosh, I've heard rumours about Big Ape picking peoples' brains, but I don't think it means that this time.

==== Miniknog Problems: A Report ====

>Not only do we have to deal with sightings of a hulking figure on the streets at night, but now the Resistance has set up shop in our little town, as well. Why can't they just let us do our jobs? All Big Ape wants is total and absolute control, is that so much to ask? 


>We have a platoon of armed guards just waiting to descend on their hideout should we find it. Free-thinking, free-spirited Apex are not welcome here. If we don't find them soon, we'll have to poison the water supply again, and then EVERYONE suffers. 

==== La Resistance ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer 
>Turns out the Apex resistance fellows are rather nice! They've given me a room of my own, and even locked the door in case the Miniknog storm in and endanger me. So thoughtful! 


>Earlier, I pulled out my rocket launcher to show them the type of weaponry the should be considering, and it caused such a ruckus! I've never seen Apex get so excited. One of them was so eager he tried to grab it from me, and we had a little accident involving an RPG and the front of the HQ. 

==== Child's Rhyme ====

>There once was an ape called Big Ape 
>Whose brain was the size of a grape 
>He swung through the trees 
>And got riddled with fleas 
>And GLORY TO BIG APE OUR GLORIOUS LEADER. HAIL THE MINIKNOG. DO NOT RESIST. 

==== The Silly Miniknog ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer 
>These Miniknog sure do treat the other Apex badly! So sad! They're always barking out orders or firing rounds into the sky. It's very tedious and stressful. Really, you can't blame me for ditching my escort, can you? 


>I happened to find myself in what I think must be a Resistance Headquarters. So rebellious! I recognised some of the faces from wanted posters. The Apex stared at me as if I was some sort of intruder or something. One of them was shivering and looked sick, so I loaned her my Big Ape-branded jacket. So kind!

==== The Kluex Delusion ====

 *The Kluex[* 아비안종족이 숭배하는 신] Delusion 1 

>p.1  by Rochard Hawkwings 
>While the Flightless blindly follow the teachings of the Clipped Council[* 아비안종족의 주요 통치기관], those of us who are enlightened - grounded, if you will - question it. Many of us, in fact, are of the opinion that Kluex does not even exist. 

 Rochard Hawkwings 지음
 Flightless들이 맹목적으로 Clipped Council(이하 CC)의 가르침을 따르는 동안, 우리같이 계몽된 아비안들 – 그렇다면 너는 아마도 Grounded의 일원일 것 이다 - 은 의문을 품었다. 사실 우리 중 대다수가 Kluex는 실제로 존재하지 않는다고 주장한다.

>p.2 What evidence is there? What SCIENTIFIC evidence? Proof. That's what the universe revolves around. There is little proof that Kluex exists, other than people who claim to have seen him. There's also his space station, of course, floating just outside of orbit. 

 무슨 근거가 있냐고? '''과학적인''' 증거라도 있냐고? 증명해주지. 그것이 인지상정이다. Kluex를  보았다고 주장하는 자들을 제외하고는, 그가 존재한다는 근거는 거의 없다. Kluex의 우주정거장도 있다. 물론, 궤도 밖에 떠있기만 한다.

>p.3 A lonely, desolate place. Fit for a god? I do not believe so. If you ask me, that space station is a spy satellite. Watching us. Recording our personal data. Sending reports to the Council about what we do, think, eat, drink. They're watching us all. 

 외롭고 쓸쓸한 곳 일거다. 신에게 어울린다고? 난 그렇게 믿지 않는다. 이유를 묻는다면 그 정거장은 정찰위성(도청위성)이기 때문이다. 우리를 감시한다. 우리의 개인정보를 기록한다. 우리가 무얼 하고, 생각하고, 먹고, 마시는지를 CC에 보고한다. 그들은 우리의 모든 것을 감시하고 있다.

 *The Kluex Delusion 2

>p.1 by Rochard Hawkwings 
>Prayer. Something the Clipped Council extol the virtues of. But how, I ask, can Kluex hear our prayers? Even according to the mythology, he is a simple Avian who ascended to Godhood through the power of flight. Flight! Not super-hearing. 

  Rochard Hawkwings 지음
 CC가 Kluex의 덕망을 찬양하는 기도문도 있다. 하지만, Kluex가 어떻게 우리의 기도를 듣겠는가? 심지어 신화에 따르면, 그는 그저 날 수 있다는 것만으로 신격화된 한 아비안에 불과하다. Kluex는 기도문을 들을 능력 따윈 없다.

>p.2 But you know what DOES have super-hearing? A SPY SATELLITE. That's right. Every time you pray, that spy satellite records your words, documents them, and saves them for use against you. Maybe the Council has been taking tips from the Apex. That makes a lot of sense. I will get to the bottom of this. 

  그러면 '''무었이''' 우리의 기도를 듣는 줄 아는가? 바로 '''도청위성''' 이다. 네가 매번 기도를 올릴 때 마다 그 정찰위성이 너의 말을 녹음하고 문서에 기록하고 네게 이용하기 위해 그것을 저장한다. 아마 CC는 에이펙스들에게서 조언을 들었을 것 이다. 아주 말이 된다. 내가 이것의 진상을 규명할 것 이다.

 *The Kluex Delusion 3

>p.1 by Rochard Hawkwings 
>I have discovered some startling similarities between Kluex and Big Ape, the ruler of the Apex. They are both mysterious figures, and they both rule. Having researched Avian history, I came to the conclusion that it's entirely possible the Clipped Council met with Big Ape in the past. 

 Rochard Hawkwings 지음
 Kluex와 에이펙스의 통치자인 Big Ape 사이의 놀라운 공통점을 찾았다. 그들은 둘 다 불가사의한 존재이며 지배한다. 아비안의 역사를 연구해본 결과, 나는 CC가 과거에 Big Ape를 분명히 만났을 것 이라고 결론지었다.

>p.2 Perhaps this is where the idea for Kluex came from. Perhaps Kluex's space station is simply filled with Miniknog technology, reading our every thought. I will reach out to Big Ape himself, for comment. 

 아마도 이것이 Kluex에대한 착안의 기원일 것 이다. 아마도 Kluex의 정거장에는 그저 우리의 모든 생각을 읽어내는 Miniknog기술로 가득 차 있을 것 이다. 난 Big Ape와 접촉하여 그를 다그칠 것 이다.

 Big Ape로부터 답장을 받았다. 그 내용은 이 책의 다음 페이지에 서술해 놓겠다.

>p.2 'Sup, Big Ape, here. Kluex, you say? A god? An Avian god? Big Ape is not familiar with this individual. But Big Ape will be happy to challenge your god Kluex to a no-holds-barred cage match, to prove ape superiority once and for all. Any time, any place, anything goes. The Miniknog are always ready.

>Love,

>Glorious Leader Big Ape' 

  '안녕하신가. Big Ape라네. Kluex라고 했나? 신 이라고? 아비안의 신? 짐은 그와 친하지 않네. 하지만 짐은 너의 신 Kluex와 치열한 전쟁을 벌인다면 기쁠 것 같네. 에이펙스의 우월함을 그를 포함한 모두에게 증명할 수 있을 것이니 말일세. Miniknog는 언제든지 준비되어 있다네.

 안부 전해주게.

 이름 높은 통치자, Big Ape가'

 Stargazer들이 나를 찾아왔다. 그들은 나에 대해, 내가 저지른 일에 대해 알고있었다. 그리고 마찬가지로 Kluex도. 나는 호출되었다.


>p.2 Let me just say I was wrong. I have been wrong this whole time. I am a fool and a rogue. Glory to Kluex. I have gazed upon our Sunborn lord with my own eyes, and I know now the truth. Grounded, it is not too late! Repent, come back to the flock. Kluex will forgive you. Do not doubt his power. 

 내가 틀렸다. 이제껏 잘못 알고 있었다. 난 그저 멍청한 사기꾼 이었다. Kluex에게 영광을! 난 내눈으로 직접 그분을 올려보았고, 이제서야 진실을 알았다. Grounded여, 아직 늦지 않았다! 참회하라! 무리로 다시 들어오라. Kluex께서 모두 용서하실 것 이다. 그분의 힘을 의심하지마라.

==== Journal of a Mechanic 1 ~ 6 ====

 *Journal of a Mechanic 1 

>Working on an airship is one step closer to my dream. I wanna be part of a starship crew - of course, who doesn't - but these airships are the next best thing. Keeping everything top notch, in working order, this is my calling. It's hard work, but no harder than living in the thrall of Kluex. Here, I'm liberated. 


>I often think back to my days training as an Ascendant. At night I dream of the Celestial Tower, of those steps leading up to the heavens, and the descent that would have awaited me at the top. All told,I prefer a deck beneath my feet. 

 *Journal of a Mechanic 2 

>I've been fooling around with the Power Crystals that keep this ship afloat, and I've come to the conclusion that I need to get my hands on some for a personal project. I miss tinkering in my workshop, creating all manner of fun contraptions. 

>Getting a hold of power crystals won't be easy, though. They are - quite understandably - regulated. It wouldn't do for just anyone to have access to them, after all! But I'm a certified PC Engineer, I should be able to pull a few strings. 

 *Journal of a Mechanic 3 

>Unable to acquire power crystals through official channels, I was able to procure some from another airship who docked with us to trade. They had an unusually large number of spare crystals in their hold, and the villagers were being somewhat cagey when I asked about this. 


>After some digging, I discovered the crystals were being traded to a certain Floran leader, in exchange for a batch of one of his experimental concoctions. I struck a deal with the captain; my silence, for a few of her crystals. A reasonable trade. 

 *Journal of a Mechanic 4 

>I've been tinkering in my workshop deep in the bowels of the ship, and created something rather remarkable. For a while now, I've been fascinated by the Glitch; those robot men who crop up every now and then. I decided to make my own. 


>My little robot is powered by a crystal, and can perform menial tasks on command. It doesn't appear to have sentience, thankfully, but it makes up for that in enthusiasm and a willingness to serve. If my experiments pan out, I could have created the ideal worker.

 *Journal of a Mechanic 5 

>I had to destroy my robot today. Some meddling Hylotl found her way to my workshop, and for some reason this turned my companion hostile. It proceeded to patrol around the ship, menacing Avians, until I was able to shut it down a few hours later. After retrieving the power crystal, I threw my robot overboard. 

>I plan to make a larger, more powerful robot, but it's going to require more power crystals. Perhaps with the right amount, I can give it enough intelligence to stop it attacking people on sight. Luckily the smuggler ship will be docking with us again later this evening, and I can make another request. 


 *Journal of a Mechanic 6 

>My attempts at blackmail have backfired. I'm here, trapped on the smuggler's ship, in the cargo hold. Kluex knows where they're taking me. Maybe they'll hand me over to this Floran I keep hearing about. There are rumblings of live experiments. 


>I have no choice but to escape. I'll have to get creative. All I have is a bunch of smuggled power crystals, my soldering iron, and my robot, which for some reason the smugglers seem to have retrieved and attempted to fix. Naturally, they've broken it even more. 


>I think I can salvage it, though. Perhaps in a different manner. I have an idea. I need a means of escaping myself, not simply a way of taking down the smugglers. Inspiration is building up inside me. 

==== Fight or Flight ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer 
>I was exploring the ship, as you do, when I encountered what appeared to be someone's private laboratory, marked with 'Keep Out' signs and warnings of delicate, breakable equipment within. I barged my way inside, and began to fiddle with all the exciting bits and bobs. 


>Imagine my alarm when, from out of nowhere, I was greeted by a dull robotic voice commanding me to 'prepare to die'. At first, I thought the Glitch had finally sent assassins to demand retribution for past transgressions, but the truth was much worse. 


>A small, misshapen robot stood before me, vibrating on the spot. It looked like it had been made out of a kettle and some saucepans, but its eyes glowed red with malevolence. I knew this was it. Me or the robot. Live or die. 


>Screaming, I ran from the room, knocking machinery hither and thither. Avians stared at me as I ran through the ship, being pursued by the robot. Nobody even stepped in to help! Eventually I had to throw myself over the side, plummeting down to meet the ground below. Thankfully, the ship was passing over an outdoor Apex marriage ceremony, and the wedding cake broke my fall. A narrow escape! 

==== Journal of a Hero ====

>I did it. I can fly. Fly like an Avian, like a Sunborn. I once again have wings. Well, jet-boots, but nonetheless, it is flight. I crafted this armour to escape from my captors, but now I shall adopt it always. I will fight for truth, justice and freedom. 


>Right now, I'm looking for a sidekick and a plan. And a cause, maybe. I hear those Apex could use a little help. Or maybe the humans. I will crusade for justice throughout the galaxy, and it will be glorious. 

==== The Iron Avian ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer 
>I boarded another airship village today, when it had stopped to dock. Climbed my way up the anchor and squirreled myself into a cabin before anyone could complain. Everything was going well; the captain, a jolly fellow called Wrenolds, allowed me to teach him how to play Lilyflip. We were half way through a game when it happened. I was winning. 


>The door to the cargo hold splintered open, and a large, metallic Avian came striding out. Swiftly he dispatched a number of the ship's crew, punching and smashing his way around. I cowered in fear, hiding behind the captain, who let off some shots from his rifle. 


>The bullets simply bounced off the iron Avian, who laughed, smashed the ship's mast, then leaped into the air. A glowing circle on his chest began to pulsate, then thrusters in the man's feet kicked in, and the Avian took off, soaring into the skies like a rocket ship. What a sight! 


>I was unaware the Avians had developed armour that allowed them to fly again. I commented on this to Wrenolds, and he told me it was unheard of. He muttered something about power crystals, and then I heard him mention my dear friend Greenfinger, who they were apparently going to see. What luck! I informed him he could drop me off there. 

==== Mallard Reynolds' Diary ====

>This Greenfinger is becoming demanding. What does he want with all these power crystals, anyway? I don't trust a client who won't meet me in person. Always sends his creepy plant people to get the deliveries. Still, that Drysap gets a high price on the black market, so can't complain. 


>That mechanic from last month wound me up no end, though. I don't respond well to blackmail. I mention this as we're docking with the ship he works on again tonight. I hope he has the good sense to leave things be. If not, we're prepared this time... 

==== Avian Power Crystals ====

>by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar
>아비안 학자,K'arn Hollowbeak 지음
>''''''
>One of our species' most proud achievements, the Power Crystals we harness can be used in all manner of ways, from machinery to lighting to cooking. These crystals are in high demand across the universe, of course, but the Avians keep them close to their chest. 
>우리 종족의 자랑스런 업적중 하나인 파워 크리스탈은 조명이나 요리부터 기계장치까지 모든 방면에서 쓰일 수 있다.
>''''''
>It is a worry, albeit an unavoidable one, that the Grounded have such ready access to the crystals. What worries me even more is that, despite using these miraculous minerals, they still deny the power of Kluex. Who else could create such wonders, if not a god? 
>한 가지 피할 수 없는 근심거리가 있다. Grounded는 이미 크리스탈을 사용하고 있다. 근심거리는, 그들이 이 기적같은 광물을 사용하면서도 여전히 클루엑스의 힘을 부인한다는 것이다. 신이 아니라면 누가 이런 놀라운걸 만들 수 있겠는가?
==== Seasick ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer
>하이로틀 모험가,Hiraki Corale 지음
>''''''
>I know, I know, a Hylotl shouldn't get seasick. But I'm in the air, not on the sea! So really, it isn't seasickness is it? Nevertheless, I've spent my days on this ship feeling exceptionally queasy, occasionally even... well, it is not polite to speak of it. 
>알아. 나도 알아. 하이로틀은 뱃멀미를 하지않지. 하지만 여긴 바다가 아니고 하늘이잖아! 그러니까, 지금 이건 뱃멀미가 아니다, 그렇지? 아무튼, 이 배에서 지내는 동안 엄청 메슥거렸어. 심지어 가끔은... 아니다, 이 말은 안하는게 좋겠다.

==== The Would-Be King 1 ~ 6 ====

 *The Would-Be King 1 

>Once upon a time, before the dawn of the Outcasts, all the Glitch lived peacefully together. They had their villages and castles and fields and all sorts of other things that robots like. They lived happily and prosperously, thousands of minds working together. But one day, a single Glitch walked into the castle, took a seat on the throne, and loudly proclaimed; 'Decisive. I am the king.' 


>The other Glitch stared at this unusual sight for a while, but did not know what to say. A self-proclaimed ruler was not something they were prepared for. As such, and with no real understanding of the situation , the Glitch were forced to obey. 


 *The Would-Be King 2 

>The new Glitch king called himself Dreadwing, and ruled with an iron fist. His subjects were expected to work day and night, which at first was not a problem for the Glitch since they rarely feel the need to rest. Soon, however, it became clear that the wear and tear on Glitch parts was an issue, and Dreadwing demanded the construction of more Glitch to boost his ranks. 


>The Glitch were puzzled here, because at no point in their species history had they ever been able to create more of their number. For as long as they could, they put off this task, until one day Dreadwing descended into a fit of such ferocious anger that the Glitch knew they had to do something. 


 *The Would-Be King 3 

>Day by day, Dreadwing grew more apoplectic as the number of Glitch never grew. In fact, his anger was such that he took to hurling his subjects from the castle tower, thus causing the population to shrink rather than grow. This made him even more angry. 


>One day, a group of Glitch scientists hit upon an idea. They had no idea how to create more of their number, of course, but they were rather adept at making stylish suits of armour. It had often been remarked upon how the armour looked like the Glitch themselves, and so they set to work commissioning a number of blacksmiths to make as many suits of armour as possible. 


 *The Would-Be King 4 

>The Glitch blacksmiths toiled day and night to create an army suitable for their lord Dreadwing. Of course, this army didn't fight, or even move, but they looked really great at certain angles. Eventually, though, the blacksmiths ran out of room for their false army, and realised it was time to unveil it. 


>This posed a problem in itself. Of course, the army was not capable of marching on the castle, or marching anywhere. A plan was needed. A plan that even Dreadwing would not question. And finally that plan came together; the Glitch would host a parade. 


 *The Would-Be King 5 

>The army paraded past on floats, towed by a number of Glitch workers and a Floran who'd decided to join in unannounced. Dreadwing sat atop his iron throne, brought outside into the city, and applauded each and every unit. 'They stand very still,' he remarked, to which his aides replied 'yes, they are very disciplined.' 


>As the last float made its way down the street, the entire crowd gasped as one of the soldiers leaped from the stand, and charged towards Dreadwing. Most surprised of all were the blacksmiths, who knew full well that their 'soldiers' were little more than decorative suits of armour. Dreadwing, however, thought it was all part of the show. 


 *The Would-Be King 6 

>King Dreadwing applauded and whooped as the armoured Glitch careened towards him. It was only as the soldier lowered its blade and charged that he suspected something was wrong. The blade pierced his metal shell, which shattered with a deafening crack. 


>All the Glitch watched as their king fell backwards, his Glitch disguise falling away, revealing a small, black and white bird-like creature. The Glitch had been duped! All this time, their tyrannical, unusual king had been a space pirate in disguise. It made perfect sense. Realising the game was up, and badly injured, the evil space pirate made his escape, never to be seen again. 


>The rogue soldier turned out to be the impromptu Floran, who had grown bored and decided to go on a hunting spree. She was made an honorary hero of the Glitch people, but then immediately exiled because killing kings is bad, even if they were penguins in disguise. From that day forth, the Glitch vowed never to allow another monarch to take control, even if they asked really nicely. 


==== The Curious Glitch ====

>by Greenfinger of the Florans 
>Ever since our two species came together, the Glitch have been a source of intrigue for me. The Hivemind Glitch remind me of our people in many ways; singularly driven, focus on teamwork. And yet the Florans work as a unit through choice, but the Glitch appear connected to some kind of central mainframe. A sentient AI, perhaps? Or something else. The truth has been lost to history. Nonetheless, it is remarkable to consider that in this way, the Florans far outmatch the Glitch in terms of societal advancement. 


>It is the Outcasts who interest me most. Many of these free-thinking Glitch have come into our midst. Their physiology means they have little to fear from the Florans, but there is more than that. There is an affinity between the two species, of which there is no denying. 


==== A Well-Folded Note ====

>Never have I felt so alone. I am surrounded by my Glitch kin, and yet I know deep down I am an outcast. At night, I sleep, and I dream. Dream! Glitch do not dream. I dream of escape, of journeying beyond the stars, of carving a life out for myself, away from this drudgery. 


>My thought process is changing. It terrifies me. I have desires, now. I question things. I almost caught myself second-guessing a directive out loud. I can feel my connection to the central consciousness fading, and while this scares me, there is a feeling of comfort there too. 


==== Guest in the Castle ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer 
>The Glitch may not be the warmest of people on the outside, but their hospitality is undisputable. They found me scaling the castle wall, simply wanting to have a look through a tower window, and politely invited me inside. Now, of course it sounded like a trap, so there was a bit of a scuffle at first, but it turned out they were genuine. 


>They offered me the run of the castle, to explore, research and investigate to my heart's content. Occasionally I run into one of them and they greet me pleasantly enough. I have been reading all manner of fascinating books, and my understanding of the Glitch is growing. 


==== A Message to all Glitch Guards ====

>We have tolerated the Outcasts at a distance, with the understanding that they do not infiltrate our most precious of sanctums; our castles, our homes, our underground fight clubs. Outcasts have infiltrated all these places. They loiter around, saying words, and having opinions. It is disconcerting and disruptive. 


>Our goodwill can only last so long. They are corrupting many of our number and severing their link with the central consciousness. As such, any Outcast spotted in a designated safe zone must be immediately arrested and sent to the laboratories for repurposing. 


==== A Slight Misunderstanding ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer 
>Due to my frequent attempts at cultural sensitivity, I decided to try and integrate myself with my hosts even more. While exploring the castle, I found a number of decorative suits of armour that appear to depict warrior Glitch. Naturally, to make my companions comfortable, I put a set on. 


>The armour was hard to walk in, so I lost my balance a few times. I came tumbling down the stairs and into the main hall, and all Glitch eyes were on me. Rather than the warm greeting I deserved, however, they began to chatter and yell. I heard the words 'Anger' and 'Disgust' a number of times. And then they began to chase me. 


==== The Prefix Problem ====

>by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer 
>Let it never be said that I do not attempt to integrate with whichever hosts I find myself indebted to. I have noticed that when addressing me, the Glitch use prefix words. Examples: 'Dismissive', 'Annoyed', 'Sarcastic' and 'Frustrated'. Feeling as if this is a custom I should celebrate, I have begun to partake in such linguistic frippery myself. 


>'Delight. It is nice to see you.' I said, but the Glitch just looked at me strangely, and then said something to his friend. I noticed something here, too. When the Glitch address each other, they do not use these prefix words. Perhaps something in their programming means they can read each others' tones without explanation.

==== A note on Glitch Outcasts ====

>by Hiraki Corale,Hylotl Adventurer 
>''''''
>The Glitch do not typically seek out and destroy any Outcasts, they simply banish them. However, some Glitch communities have developed a repurposing process, a few mechanical tweaks that reformats a Glitch mind and strengthens the bond to the hivemind.

>As such, many Outcasts seek to flee the cities, reaching out for help from the Outcast sleeper agents who operate within the walls. Thrilling! It's like being in a spy novel.

>Leeron: Considerate. I would assess their workings to see if the model appeared functional. If not, I would find a contact address and advise the best course of action. All Glitch must be maintained properly for continued efficiency. 


==== A note on Glitch Individuals ====

>by Hiraki Corale,Hylotl Adventurer 
>''''''
>The Glitch call their free-thinking peers 'Outcasts', but there are certain Glitch who are allocated identities with permission, and thus remain in their chosen role. For example, I found a Glitch whose job it is to gaze wistfully up at the stars and talk about 'the good old days'. 
>''''''
>Another Glitch, a master chef, has been forced to remain in her job role due to the fact 'she makes the best pancakes'. Then there are law enforcement officers, mysterious kung fu masters, and town criers. However, there does not seem to be any definite ruler, which is interesting indeed. 


==== A Glitch poster ====

>'''WARNING: Outcasts operate in this area''' 
>''''''
>A number of Outcasts have been spotted in this area, sharing ideas and philosophies with all who will listen. 
>''''''
>'''DO NOT LISTEN!''' 
>''''''
>Individual behaviour will not be tolerated, and will upset the Glitch way of life. Do not accept it. Should you encounter an Outcast behaving badly, ensure you contact the relevant authorities, or failing that, hit them repeatedly with a large hammer until they go away. 


==== A note on Glitch Hierarchy ====

>by Hiraki Corale,Hylotl Adventurer 
>''''''
>The Glitch - at least those who remain true to their roots - are unusual in that they have no hierarchy system. Their roles are interchangeable; a Glitch who may be a baker one day will be a stonemason the next. What is curious is the lack of vocal organisation. 
>''''''
>In my time here, I've never heard the Glitch planning these roles, they simply happen, working like clockwork. Despite the species' somewhat backwards technological state, they're remarkably efficient. 
>''''''
>They operate as a hivemind, but what's strange about that is the Glitch have developed self-awareness, yet these robots appear to CHOOSE this way of life, vehemently rejecting those - the Outcasts - who begin to think for themselves. Exciting!

>His cold metal body lying in a repair shop somewhere, waiting for justice. He never left the village, they tell me, which points to one thing. The killer was someone close to him. A wolf in steel clothing. An Outcast in our midst.

>Hit the streets, asked around. For a while, nothing to go on. Then a breakthrough. Our murdered Glitch has been working a certain role more often than is usual. Window cleaner. One particular house, in fact. Often at night. Curious.

==== The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 1 ~ 11  ====

 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 1 

>It's not often a Glitch bounty hunter finds themselves tasked with visiting a human settlement, and yet here I am. I will be honest; I'm not fond of humans. They appear Glitch-like but fleshy, without the hardy muscular physique of the Apex. 


>Here, though, in this place, I can't help but pity them as a species. Misery and torment seems to exude from every surface. Graffiti marks the walls; cries for help and sinister warnings. Something bad walked these hallways. I can feel it. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 2 

>I am here on the behest of Platinum, tracking down an Apex who stole the locations of a number of Glitch Outcast camps. The Apex, I was told, had disguised himself as a human and promptly been thrown in prison. 


>If he was here, however, he isn't any more. The place is desolate and ruined. It feels like it was a mistake to come here. Were I not made of metal, I imagine I'd be feeling chills run down my spine. I do not like this place. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 3 

>The further I proceed into the complex, the more evidence I'm finding of the villains who once dwelt here. Thieves, terrorists, murderers, the scum of the universe. Perhaps their evil became tangible and seeped into the very walls of this place. Or perhaps it is something more. 


>The Glitch do not believe in the concept of an afterlife, but many other species do. Humans, though, seem to be the most prone to superstition. Ghosts, spectres, the return of their kind to life, but in a non-corporeal form. Perhaps it is the light playing tricks on me, but as I head onwards into the prison, I fancy I keep seeing movement out of the corner of my eye. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 4 

>I blacked out, earlier. Simply as if my body had shut down. The last thing I remember is a strange electromagnetic pulse, as if a current passed through my body, and then nothing. Diagnostics all scan okay, but I am wary. 


>When I awoke, I had somehow crawled to a different room. I was lying on a prison cell bed, but I wasn't alone. A bald doll with one eye sat on the mattress beside me, staring. It appeared to be some kind of human toy. I scanned it for signs of life, then mocked myself for doing so. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 5 

>Something is watching me. I've descended so deep into this prison that the lights no longer work, and I'm forced to navigate with night vision. As I made my way down a corridor, my scanner flickered into action, alerting me to a life sign just behind me. I whirled around, and nothing. 


>Every ounce of logic I possess wants to believe it is my quarry, hiding from me in plain sight, perhaps taking stock of his pursuer, but something - an intuition I only gained after severing ties with the hivemind - tells me it is not. I do not think my quarry has been alive for a long time. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 6 

>I awoke in the night to the sounds of wailing. There were two strange things about this. One, I had been asleep. My progress through the prison has been so slow that there has been no need to rest in order to recharge, and yet I was overcome with fatigue. 


>Two, no life signs detected. None. And yet the wailing was clearly coming from within the room I found myself in. A low, tortured cry, unlike anything I've heard before. Unlike any species I've heard before. I am on the verge of abandoning my mission and turning back. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 7 

>What is it for a Glitch to know fear? I have felt it before, of course; it is a side effect of the severing. But this, this is different. The more I take in the history of the prison, piecing together events from scrawled messages and disrepair, the more I begin to feel human. 


>This species, these humans, are lost and adrift in the universe. Would it not make sense that even their very souls, if such a thing exists, cannot find peace? They have an emotional range quite unlike that of any other species; a conflicting, terrible sea of confusion. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 8 

>I found a locked cell. Scans indicate a life sign from within. Something lurks in there. I know that, given the tools in my possession, I could get in. I know that I SHOULD, as it may be my quarry. And yet I hesitate. 


>As I wait outside the door, I hear a voice whispering to me. It calls me by name, and by names I've never heard before. It talks of beings made of light, and beings made of darkness. It talks of a god that will swallow the universe. And it talks of humanity. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 9 

>I opened the door. The room was empty, save for a single chair, upon which sat the doll. I picked the thing up, and with a surge of anger, threw it on the ground and stamped on it. The plastic shattered beneath my foot. 


>As I glanced up, a shadow passed across the wall, and the door behind me slammed shut. I fumbled, trying to get out, and finally as I did so, caught sight of a figure disappearing around the corner up ahead. 


 *The Steel Casebook: Prisoners 10 

>I followed the shadow all throughout the complex. It led me on a merry chase, always one step ahead. But finally I caught up with it. It took a dead end, there was nowhere to hide. Now I wait outside of its sanctuary, building up my courage. 


>This ends now. I am a Glitch. I do not believe in the soul, or spirits. I will prove this thing is flesh and blood, and if necessary, I will take it in. Hewlett Deckard will not be toyed with.

==== Ghosts in the Walls ====

>We heard 'em, back when we was locked up. They was everywhere. This place, all the places like this, evil to the core. We thought we left that suffering back on Earth, in the belly of a beast, but no. 


>There's Mad Mary, searching for her lost baby. Dominic Darmanin, the axe murderer. Killer Betty Simpson, who loved a Floran. Anthony Muldoon, with his hook for a hand. And Harkaway Jones, the killer of the Apex. We hears 'em all. Most nights, they come out to play.

>Received communication for the first time in years. Wasn't Earth, but someone claiming to be a Hylotl, saying they were outside our door and it was really cold outside. Not falling for that one. Ignored it.
